# Arithmetic Operators
x = 2
y = 4

# sum
total = x + y

# subtraction
total = x - y

# multiplication
total = x * y

# division
total = x / y

# modulus
total = x % y

# exponential
total = x ** y

print(total)

# Comparison operators

# greater than
(x > y)

# lesser than
(x < y)

# equal
(x == y)

# different
(x != y)

# membership operators
first_tuple = (1, "devOps", 3.5)
ans = "devOps" in first_tuple

# identity operator
a = 12
b = 12

result = a is b
print(result)
